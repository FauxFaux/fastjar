TODOs for FastJar
-----------------

* add pb_read_fully function.

* add doxygen documentation.

* turn on-stack arrays into dynamically allocated ones.

* indexing should also work with several jars.

* add pscan, rats, flawfinder & splint support to distcheck.

* add many more gcc warnings to build.

* add autotest based testsuite for cxtui operations & the CVE issue.

* eventually: use autogen for option parsing? use glib? use zzlib? use libjar from firefox?

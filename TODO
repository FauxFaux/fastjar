TODOs for FastJar
-----------------

* indexing should also work with several jars.

* merge in patches from gcc bugzilla from fastjar issue marked as WONTFIX.

* merge in patches from distributions.

* add pscan, rats, flawfinder & splint support to makefile & distcheck.

* add many more gcc warnings to build.

* test building with Sun CC on solaris.

* add autotest based testsuite for cxtui operations & the CVE issue.

* eventually: use autogen for option parsing? use glib? use zzlib? use libjar from firefox?
